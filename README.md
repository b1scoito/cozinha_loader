## Info
Automatically inject a DLL into the selected process with _VAC3 bypass_.

This will only, most likely, work only with _source engine_ games in _steam_ that use _VAC3_ as a protection measure and load `serverbrowser.dll` as a process module.

## Does not open
If your error is `msvcp140.dll`, Please install the following libraries, `x86` is required. `x64` is optional but recommended.
- https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
- https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

Any other error, please make an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/b1scoito/cozinha_loader/issues).

## Compiling
